<p>My lovely Nissan Skyline GTS25t outside my London house. Can't import them into the US so I had to sell it when we moved here.</p>

<p>Shows just how long this car is - those are very usable back seats. The length is one reason they gave it rear-wheel steer.</p>

<p>The distinctive four round tail lights of the R33 Skyline. I really like the look of the integral spoiler.</p>

<p>The current Forsyth Fleet - the sunlight on the Scooby hides just how filthy we let it get. Sorry mate - three cars and two garage spaces means the cheap one gets to live outside under the trees.</p>

<p>The wife acts as both showroom dolly-bird and as a handy scale-setter for the tiny Seven.</p>

<p>"NOT A 6" - like the paint scheme, it's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv813f2Xtrg">Prisoner</a> reference. "You are number 6." Except of course it isn't - it's... it's one louder.</p>
<p>"NEE-SAN" - means "honoured big sister" in Japanese, because the GT-R is a lady of refinement and taste. Also, at 3800lbs, she is kinda big.</p>

<p>Where did that pesky Seven get to?</p>

<p>I also have a race-car Seven. Mechanically it's very similar to the road car, except for the obvious changes to the bodywork. The suspension is stiffer, the brakes are much better, and it uses a dry-sumped 2.3liter engine de-tuned to 200hp, but otherwise it drives very similarly - it has exactly the same chassis, gearbox, and LSD.</p>
